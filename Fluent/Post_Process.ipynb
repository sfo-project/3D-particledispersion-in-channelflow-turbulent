    "# CFD Results Post-Process & Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**The final step for the development of a CFD simulation for a problem of interest is to process and examine the validity of the obtained numerical results (a.k.a post-processing and validation step). These steps requires an in-depth engineering knowledge about the fundamentals of the physical problem of interest. Thus, the value of investing time in understanding the fundamental physics of the flow, once again is highlighted here. This process is done starting from general inspection on CFD simulation results and ends with more detail validation process.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data post-processing and validation of this case study is done with a different approach compared to the `Tier I` case studies of SFO-Project: majority parts of the data post-processing is done via a MATLAB script on the extracted particle text (.txt) file via the compiled User Defined Function (UDF) as discussed earlier in the `Simulation` part. Users can access all of the required files from UDF, MATLAB script and other files in Simulation_Src folder of the repository. In this section the obtained DRW numerical results using two different Lagrangian time scale constants $C_L$ of $0.15$ (default value) and $0.1$ (calibrated value) is presented and compared with the experimental data of Snyder and Lumley.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of post-processing is visualization of simulation's residuals. Fig. 1 visualizes the residual values of continuity, streamwise velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and frequency versus the number of iterations. The general decreasing trend of residual values confirm that the numerical solution of the conservation/governing equations are converging to specific final values. Usually the residuals for the continuity decrease with the slower rate compare to other residual values. Therefore, a continuity residual of 10E-3, is the first necessary but not sufficient general criteria to confirm the convergence of the CFD simulation in general. In this case this criteria is reached after about 20 iterations and after about 250 iterations the continuity residuals reached value of 10E-12, which is a solid confirmation of CFD simulation convergence.\n",

    "The second step of post-processing is to validated the simulated turbulent flow in the test section of the experiment. As mentioned earlier in the Simulation section the inlet streamwise velocity was set to $6.55~\\frac{m}{s}$, matching the experiment conditions. The values of turbulent kinetic energy, $\\kappa$, and turbulent frequency, $\\omega$, at the inlet of the computational domain, not provided explicitly in Rybalko et al. [2], are chosen as $\\kappa~=~0.35~\\frac{m}{s^2}$ and $\\omega~=~425~\\frac{m^2}{s^3}$  based on a trial and error approach in order to provide the closest match to the profiles of turbulent kinetic energy and rates evolution inside the Snyder & Lumley's wind tunnel test section [1]. Fig. 2 shows comparisons between the numerical (blue) and experimental (red) decay of turbulent kinetic energy, $\\kappa$, and dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, on the centerline of the domain along the channel length, with the channel length normalized by the grid spacing ($M$). Except for a slight disagreement between the measured and predicted turbulent dissipation rate for $\\frac{x}{M}~=~60$ to $80$, the overall experimental and numerical results show good agreement. This confirms the validity of the simulated flow field at the test section of the experiment.\n",

    "The last step of post-processing is to fully analyze the particle dispersion data predicted via the DRW model and compare them against the experimental results [1]. The provided MATLAB scripts is developed such that users only would need to input the value of the free stream velocity at the inlet of the test section `Velocity_at_inlet` variable, value of used time scale constant $C_L$ and the correct name of the exported `.txt` data file.

    "After providing these two inputs running the script will automatically post-process the results and provides three plots. The provided MATLAB script is commented extensively within the body of the code. Hence, the details of the analysis steps are not presented here and it is assumed that users can understand the code on their own. Here only the obtained results are presented and discussed here.\n",

    "The first output of the MATLAB script is the comparison between the averaged eddy-life time scale ($I_{DRW}$), predicted via the DRW modeled, and the Lagrangian time scale ($I_{Taylor}$), calculated by integration of the obtained velocity autocorrelation function defined based on the G.I. Taylor Dispersion's theory [3,4]. This comparison is the first validation step of the time scale coefficient ($C_L$) value. Table 1 shows time scale constant value of $C_L~=~0.1$, obtained by trial and error, minimizes the difference between the two time scale values. Since the default value of the DRW time-sale constant, $C_L~=~0.15$, was originally based on lab-scale experimental data, including Snyder & Lumley's, the optimum value of the time scale constant changed significantly: $\\~ ~30~\\%$. However, this confirms the fact that, even for this experimental data, part of the database used to set the default value for $C_L$ , the calibration procedure has ample room to reduce the error in the numerical modeling of dispersion. It is showed that for larger scale, high Reynolds number turbulent flows, the application of calibration methodology leads to changes of the time-scale values of an order of magnitude (up to ≈94%) [3,5].  \n",

    "Fig. 3 shows the calculated velocity autocorrelation functions based on dispersion of injected hollow glass particles simulated by the DRW model with time scale constant of 0.15 and 0.1. This comparison visualizes the root of the differences between the presented numbers in Table 1. Decreasing the value of time scale constant $C_L$ makes the initial decay of the velocity autocorrelation function more rapid and further fluctuations around the zero value. This is a more realistic representation of the velocity autocorrelation function for an isotropic and homogeneous turbulent flow at the test section and lead to a closer equivalent time scale value predicted via the DRW model [4, 5].\n",

    "A flow visualization of the hollow glass particles injected at a point and dispersed by turbulence vertically within the test section are shown in Fig. 4 with the goal to highlight how the uncalibrated DRW model overestimates dispersion by an order of magnitude. This figure shows 500 trajectories obtained by the DRW model with the default time scale parameter value $C_L~=~0.15$, side by side to those obtained with the calibrated time scale parameter $C_L~=~0.1$. The interaction of particles with the same eddy for a long vertical distance is noticeable on the left panel of Fig. 4 for $C_L~=~0.15$. This behavior along with many similar, physically-unrealistic, long particle-eddy interactions drives particles at implausible and large dispersion angles away from the injection point.  \n",
    "On the other side of the spectrum the particle-eddy interactions on the right panel of Fig. 4 are much more realistic, with particle-eddy interactions lasting from a few to tens of seconds and smaller dispersion angles. The turbulent diffusion process of the particles is much more continuous, and looks more natural. The ensemble effect is a more gradual, moderate, cloud dispersing from the injection source, as opposed to the high-sloped, extreme trajectories that result from the particles interacting with the same large eddy for their entire residence time in the flow predicted with the wrong value of the time scale-constant. This consistency is confirmed by the results from the Lagrangian velocity autocorrelation function.\n",

For a value of the calibrated time-scale coefficient of $C_L~=~0.1$ Fig. 2 shows excellent agreement between DRW prediction and corresponding experimental data, much better than for the default value of the coefficient. Furthermore, this comparison confirms that the DRW model using default $C_L$ value overestimates the dispersion of particles significantly compared to the experimental data.\n",

    "At this stage users have obtained a robust and experimentally validated CFD simulation setup to numerically model the dispersion of particles, with reasonable Stokes number, in a highly isotropic turbulent flows. It should be highlighted that consistent results for modeling dispersion of copper particles, higher Stokes number, within the Snyder-Lumley experiment were obtained [3,6].\n",

    "**Users should be note that the provided validation methodology in this tutorial is applicable to the case studies were the actual experimental data are available, which is not the case in majority of applications! Hence, to calibrate the DRW model for particle dispersion simulation in a turbulent flow of interest, following steps are recommended: \n",
    "1) Simplify the turbulent flow of interest into a homogenueos and isotropic turbulent flow.  2) Simulate the dispersion of 500 or more flow tracers within that turbulent flow.  \n",
    "3) Using the provided methodology here perform a trial and error between different time scale constant ($C_L$) values to match the flow tracers dispersion predicted by the G.I. Taylor's theory using the provided MATLAB script. \n",
    "At this stage users have developed an acceptable level of confidence in validity of the DRW model application for their turbulent flow field of interest by matching G.I. Taylor's dispersion theory. Now the calibrated time scale constant $C_L$ value can be used for more complicated turbulent flow field of interest. A sample of data files of flow tracer dispersion in a simplified tidal channel (i.e. without turbine operation) and corresponding MATLAB script to post-process and compare obtained DRW data against G.I. Taylor theory is presented at Simulation_Scr/DRW_Calibration_TidalChannel folder.**\n",
